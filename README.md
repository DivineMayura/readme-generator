# readme-generator
This application is a readme generator. After initializing, the user is issued a series of prompts from which they can enter the desired information to be displayed on the readme. In the future, I plan to implement more licenses, and more options so the user has more agency over the initial creation, and better image options. This readme was completely created using the generator, except for the video.
